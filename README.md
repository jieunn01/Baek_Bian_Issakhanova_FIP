### About MSF Campaign

We let people know exactly what MSF(Medicines Sans frontiers), one of the NGOs that citizens want to solve what the government cannot solve. Create a web page so that individual sponsors can trust and sponsor by giving them an opportunity to participate in good behavior and introducing the impact of individual sponsors on MSF.

### Our Goals

It will be important to communicate accurate information to people about exactly what kind of organization MSF is and to emphasize MSF's policy of more than 90 percent of private sponsorship, showing the power of positive influence that ordinary individuals can have in design elements. Due to this is a campaign that gathers people, people's interest is only when information comes in at a glance, and our goal is to make many people participate in this meaningful sponsorship with an interesting design work that is important to explain and participate in.
